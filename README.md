# Bash Settings

These are my bash settings. They are loaded, when opening up the terminal using the .bash_profile. Settings itself are in .bashrc.

Example path:

    stefan@mac:~/private/tutorials$

Example git repo:

    stefan@mac:~/private/bash_settings[master]$

## Source

The settings are taken from [Bash Prompt Generator](http://ezprompt.net/)
